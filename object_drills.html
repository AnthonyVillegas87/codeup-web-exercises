  //  getAverageBalance() should return the average balance per users
  //  getLowestBalance() should return the customer name with the lowest balance
  //  getHighestBalance() should return the customer name with the highest balance
  //  getMostFavoriteFruit() should return the most common fruit
  //  getLeastFavoriteFruit() should return the least favorite fruit
  //  getTotalNumberOfUnreadMessages() should return the number of unread messages for all users
  //  getAverageNumberOfUnreadMessages() should return the average number of unread mesages per user.
  //  getAverageAge() should return the average age of all users
  //  getGenderCounts() should return gender count of users as an object: example {"m": 23, "f", 32}
  //  getAllCompanyNames() should return an array of all companies represented by the users
  //  getMostCommonEyeColor() should return the most commonly occuring eye-color.
  //  getBalancesForActiveAndNonActive() should return the balance of all non-active accounts vs. the balance of all active accounts?
  //     this last method should return an object that looks like {"active-balances": 23000, "inactive-balances": 4000} w/ different numbers.


  // Exercise 6. Practice with assignment by reference
  // create a variable named person1 with a name property. Assign it a name property.
  // Now create a variable named person2 and assign person1 to it.
  // Then reassign the name property on person2 with person2.name = "Bob";
  // console.log the name property on person 1.
  // Why do you think changing person2 altered person1?
  // The term for this behavior is assignment by reference.


  // Exercise 7. More practice with assignment by reference
  // Add the following HTML to your index.html page in this project.
  // <input type="text" id="input" name="input">
  // now, create a variable named input and assign it document.getElementById("input").
  // now run input.value = "Hello" from the JS console. Did you see any HTML change?
  // Create a second variable named inputElement.
  // var inputElement = document.getElementById("input");
  // now, run inputElement.value = "I am altering an object by altering its properties" in your JS console.
  // See how both the "input" and "textInput" varialbes are referencing the same underlying HTML element?
  // This behavior is another example of "assignment by reference"
